# Hypixel Level/Progress Display
This program displays the current level and progress to their next level for [Minecraft Hypixel](https://hypixel.net/) games Bed Wars and SkyWars. The color and font of each level is also shown.

This is aimed for use with livestreams of these games as a supplement to the viewer experience. I originally created it to show my progress to 300âœ« in Bed Wars and level 15 in SkyWars.

## Setup
Download the zip of this repository at the top of the page and extract it to a known location.

Download and install [this Minecraft font](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Font/releases/download/v1.0/Minecraft.otf).

Navigate to `api.js` and change the variables at the top of the file to:
- `api_key`: Connect to the Hypixel Network (mc.hypixel.net) and run the command `/api` to get your api key.
- `uuid`: Go to the website https://namemc.com/ and input your username. The uuid should be on your profile.

Your `api.js` should look like this
```
// do /api in hypixel and add the key below
api_key = "967211bc-1ed9-4343-9792-48fdbbda707a" (FAKE API KEY)

// look up your UUID and put it here
uuid = "f73b37d0137b40e682b1b5e400617ca6" (ThatHypedPerson UUID)
...
```
